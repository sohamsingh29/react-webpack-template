# React Webpack Template

 A ready to use React template which is super light and fast to use for development purposes.


## Motivation

- So if you want to start a react project its very easy to do with create-react-app but i feel its somewhat slow for development as it takes a lot of extra time in dev server.

- For that reason people use webpack to their app as it enhances performance and development speeds.

- But for webpack it is somewhat time consuming to create the app around 10 min and then you start adding your own dependencies.

## Features

 - Most people use [styled components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) or [twin.macros](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro) for dev purposes so its already added.
 - Two steps and you can start your project.
 - Equip with React, ES6 & Babel 6.
 - Build with Webpack 5.
 - Fast refresh enabled.
 - Auto Open a new browser tab when Webpack loads, and reload the page when you modified the code.
 - Lint with Eslint (about to add).


## Installation

#### NodeJs and Npm must be installed before using this (obviously) 
```
clone this repo and then in the terminal
 
npm install
 
npm start
```
#### If you  want to remove twin.macros just remove twin object from package.json babel macros and remove from dependency

## Usage

- Usage is very straight forward like a regular create-react-app nothing fancy
